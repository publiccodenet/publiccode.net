  <div><h2>Building the story a codebase needs to be noticed and re-used</h2>

  <p>
    We manage and mature products to help them shine on their own, build branding and plan communications to ensure codebases get adopted by re-users and contributors, and support both development and design.

  <div><h2>Operating globally, thinking locally</h2>  
  <p>
    For local implementations we collaborate with partners to integrate effectively in the local context, while simultaneously making it easier for others to implement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our focus on ecosystems — rather than nations or cities — ensures context-specific code or policy is never a barrier to implementation, and that code is globally reusable.
