# Signalen

> Stage 1: assessment

## What it is

Signalen makes it easier for residents to make a nuisance report, and helps the city respond to the most important things first.

It includes:

* algorithmic processing by type of complaint and second layer triaging and prioritization by humans
* automatic updates to complainants about the status of their report
* automatic alerts to city staff based on analysis of combined reports
* easy report transfer to other city workers and subcontractors

## How we're helping

We’re helping Amsterdam and the VNG define a governance structure, including shared feature roadmaps and technical steering.

We’re also helping make the codebase more conducive to collaboration, including:

* clear branching and gitflow models
* automated unit tests and integration testing
* engineering guidelines
* help prepare the community to empower market parties to offer the solution as a service (SaaS)

## Technology

Languages and frameworks: Django Python

## Community

Created by: Amsterdam, the Netherlands (2018)

Replicating: Strong interest from other Dutch cities and the Association of Dutch Municipalities (VNG, representing 355 municipalities), as well as Ghent (Belgium) as part of the European [SCORE project](https://score.community/)

## Opportunity

Scaling potential: other Dutch municipalities

The Association of Dutch Municipalities (VNG) wants to make it ‘one click deployable’ from their Common Ground appstore.

Amsterdam, the VNG and 's-Hertogenbosch have asked for our expertise while they refactor the codebase to be more modular and reusable while it’s in production in Amsterdam.
