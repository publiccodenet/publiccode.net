The [Standard for Public Code](https://standard.publiccode.net/) gives public organizations a model for preparing open source solutions to enable collaborations with similar public organizations in other places.
It includes guidance for policy makers, city administrators, developers and vendors.

[All codebases in stewardship](/codebases) with the Foundation for Public Code have chosen to apply the Standard to their own work.

The Standard is recognized as a [Digital Public Good](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry/standard-for-public-code.html) by the [Digital Public Goods Alliance](https://digitalpublicgoods.net).

The CITYxCITY Academy has a [free online course](https://citybycity.academy/course/standards-for-smart-cities) covering the Standard for Public Code.

## Standard compliance or certification process

The Foundation for Public Code ensures that codebases under its stewardship (and not in incubation or the attic) are compliant with the Standard for Public Code.
This makes clear to potential users and contributors that the codebase is of high quality, and updates will be too.

The audit performed by the Foundation for Public Code is meant to complement machine testing, as machines are great at testing things like syntax and whether outcomes align with expectations.
Things meant for humans are impossible for machines to test, like whether documentation is actually understandable and accessible in context, the commit messages make sense, and community guidelines are being followed.

The audit tests the entire codebase, including source code, policy, documentation and conversation for compliance with both the standards set out by the Foundation for Public Code and the standards set out in the codebase itself.

### How the process works

Every time a contribution is suggested to a codebase, for example through a merge request, the [codebase stewards](https://about.publiccode.net/roles/) of the Foundation for Public Code will audit the contribution for compliance with the Standard for Public Code.
New contributions can only be adopted into the codebase after they have been approved as compliant with the Standard for Public Code, and have been reviewed by another contributor.

The audit is presented as a review of the contribution.
The codebase steward gives line by line feedback and compliance, helping the contributor to improve their contribution.
The merge request cannot be fulfilled until the codebase stewards have approved the contribution.

### Certifying an entire codebase versus a contribution

For the codebase to be completely certified every meaningful line of code, and the commits behind the code, need to meet the Standard.

If codebases have been completely audited from the first merge request they can be immediately certified as compliant with the Standard for Public Code.

If the audit process is added to an existing codebase, the new merge requests can be certified, but the existing code will not be automatically certified.
By auditing every new merge request the codebase can move incrementally towards being completely certified.
The codebase stewards can also do a complete audit of a codebase, at the current commit, and start applying the process from then to ensure that a codebase stays certified.

## The goals for the Standard for Public Code

This Standard supports developers, designers, managers and policy makers to:

* develop high quality software and policy for better public service delivery
* develop codebases that can be reused across contexts and collaboratively maintained
* reduce technical debt and project failure rate
* have more granular control over, and ability to make decisions about, their IT systems
* improve vendor relationships with a better economic model

The Foundation for Public Code helps public organizations share and adopt open source software, build sustainable developer communities and create a thriving ecosystem for public code.
It does this through codebase stewardship.
For this process the codebase stewards use the Standard for Public Code to make sure the code it stewards is high quality as well as collaboratively maintainable.

Potential users of codebases tested against the Standard for Public Code can expect them to be highly reusable, easily maintainable and of high quality.

The Standard for Public Code does this by:

* setting out a common terminology for public code development
* establishing measures to help develop high quality public code
* providing guidance on how to fulfill its criteria and operationalize compliance

The Standard for Public Code is meant to be time and technology independent.

## Make the Standard better

We welcome feedback on how to make the Standard more useful, especially if you work with policy at a public organization or software development.

You can contribute to the Standard by:

* raising an [issue](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues) on GitHub, or opening a [pull request](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md)
* joining one of our monthly [community calls](https://about.publiccode.net/activities/community-calls/), held every first Thursday of the month
