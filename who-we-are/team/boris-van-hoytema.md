# Boris van Hoytema

Having a hard time in school, Boris van Hoytema found out that you can learn anything you want on the internet and that whenever youâ€™re stuck, there are others that want to help. Passionate about bringing this collaborative attitude to the public sector Boris founded the Foundation for Public Code.

Boris has an entrepreneurial nature and has worked at the City of Amsterdam as Open Source advisor, the [SCORE programme](https://northsearegion.eu/score) as Open Source Development Manager, VurbAgency on urban open technology and the BBC and VPRO on innovative public broadcasting.
