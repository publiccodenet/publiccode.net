# Matthew Claudel

Matthew Claudel leads strategy for the Foundation for Public Code North America.

Matthew is founder and principal at Field States, a benefit company that works with forward-thinking organizations to discover place-based potential and bring it to life—creating new forms of value for people and the planet. He was previously the Strategic Design Lead for Curative, a health care company seeking to end the Covid-19 pandemic, and co-founded MIT’s designX program, where he was the Head of Civic Innovation and an instructor for four years.

Matthew serves as Open Smart City Advisor for Open North, and is also Visiting Assistant Professor at University of Michigan’s Taubman School of Architecture. Matthew has written two books, and several academic journal articles, fiction and general publications primarily related to technology, cities, art, and the natural environment.

He has a PhD in Advanced Urbanism from MIT, where his work focused on the emerging practices of city-scale experimentation as they relate to civic value.
